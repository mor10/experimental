# experimental
This is an experimental Github repository in which I will do some experiments to test out different teaching techniques for this service and the Git application.

## The README.md file
In Github you are required to have a README.md file in every repository. This is the file that displays the content on the front page of your repository. In some cases the entire repository consists of only this file.

The ".md" extension refers to the markup language used in Github: Markdown. Markdown purportedly makes it easier to write HTML, though I tend to disagree.

But that's just me.

## Main branch changes
Now we are working on two branches. One is the master - or main - branch, the other is an alternate one. The changes I'm making now are in the Master branch. Because I've already branched off from it these changes will not be added in the alternative branch.

## Rebasing
This is where things get interesting. Now I'm going to make several changes to the same file in different branches. This would be similar to you doing work on a fork while the master branch moves forward.
