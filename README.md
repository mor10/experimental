# experimental
This is an experimental Github repository in which I will do some experiments to test out different teaching techniques for this service and the Git application.

## The README.md file
In Github you are required to have a README.md file in every repository. This is the file that displays the content on the front page of your repository. In some cases the entire repository consists of only this file.

The ".md" extension is a reference to a markupl language called "Markdown" which is quite popular among open source developers. Markdown is a shorthand language that makes it easier to write HTML quickly. The problem with Markdown is you need to run a task in the background to translate it: No applications read Markdown natively.

## Main branch changes
Now we are working on two branches. One is the master - or main - branch, the other is an alternate one. The changes I'm making now are in the Master branch. Because I've already branched off from it these changes will not be added in the alternative branch.

## Fast Forward
When there are no conflicts, rather than a merge you get what's called a "Fast Forward". This just means that the files are added onto or changed automatically and nothing is really merged.
